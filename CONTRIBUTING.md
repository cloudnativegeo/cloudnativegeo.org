# Contributing to the CNG Website

We welcome contributions of blog posts to this site using the following editorial guidelines.

## What we’re looking for
**Evergreen topics** - We are always open to content about new ways of using geospatial data, case studies that include data that show the benefits of using cloud-native approaches, technical tutorials, open-source tools, best practices in geospatial data management, and cases that help data users share, access, and work with geospatial data more effectively.   

**Current priorities** - This year, we are also interested in blog posts that address the following common community challenges that we’ve identified:  

- Education and workforce development  
- Ways to simplify data licensing to accelerate data usage  
- Creating better shared data resources  
- Ways to improve government partnerships  
- Sustainable funding models for collaborative projects
- Marketing to communicate the value of cloud-native approaches

**Tone** - Collaborative and community-centric. Always try to find ways to include ways that readers can engage and contribute to your topic.  

**Length** - 700-1,500 words, depending on the complexity of the topic.  

**Visuals** - We encourage visuals such as relevant diagrams, screenshots, or code snippets where appropriate to make the content more visually engaging. We will not include decorative imagery or stock photography.  

**Avoid** pitching products or approaches without showing clear value to the community and ways that they can contribute to it. Note that CNG Commercial Members are eligible to publish one branded blog post per year, and they should still follow the spirit of these guidelines.

# Blog submission process

1. **Submit GitHub Issue**  
Create an issue in GitHub using the “Blog Post Proposal for Writers” issue template at [github.com/cloudnativegeo/cloudnativegeo.org/issues](https://github.com/cloudnativegeo/cloudnativegeo.org/issues). 

2. **Board discussion / voting**   
Get approval from the Board — at least two CNG Board members must approve the proposal. Board members may vote as follows by commenting on the GitHub issue:  
- `+1` indicates strong support and a willingness to help implement the proposal.  
- `+0` indicates mild support, but has no effect.  
- `0` indicates no opinion and has no effect.  
- `-0` indicates mild disagreement, but has no effect.  
- `-1` indicates opposition and acts as a veto; however, the voter must provide clear reasoning and suggest alternate solutions.  

Two +1’s will mark the blog proposal as accepted. 

3. **Write blog post**  
Write your blog post in a Google Doc. 

4. **Seeking board review**  
After writing, share the Google Doc with the CNG Editorial Board via email: [editorial-board@cloudnativegeo.org](mailto:editorial-board@cloudnativegeo.org). You'll need to lobby for at least one reviewer from the Editorial Board – reach out to a board member and request their feedback on your draft.  

The board’s role is to advise you to ensure it aligns with our goals of accessibility, usability, and practical value to the community.  
    
5. **Revise blog post**  
Based on feedback, revise your draft and resubmit it to your reviewer. You may need to repeat this step until your content is ready.
