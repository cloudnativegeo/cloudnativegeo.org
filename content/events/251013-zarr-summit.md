title: "Zarr Development & Adopter Summit"
when_date: "13-17 October, 2025"
where: "Rome, Italy"
description: "The people steering, implementing, and adopting Zarr to accelerate progress and shape the future of open science with multi-dimensional data are gathering together in Rome, Italy this fall.  

​Monday - Wednesday - Zarr development summit.  
Thursday - Friday - Zarr adopter summit. 

​The first three days of the summit will produce a formal extension and prototype for variable chunk grid support in Zarr, improvements and demonstrations of sharding, and the formalization of highly performant compression and other codecs for Zarr. We will support Zarr v3 adoption during the final two days of the summit, including an invitation to all STAC Sprint participants to join us on Friday October 17.  

​By the conclusion of the meeting, we will have a roadmap for feature parity across Zarr implementations, multiple new adopters of the Zarr V3 format, and a plan for subsequent outreach, including a webinar and blog post highlighting the products of the summit and the benefits of adopting Zarr for open science.  

We encourage folks using or evaluating Zarr to join us for adopter days on October 16-17. We anticipate an intimate gathering where you can benefit from:  

- Direct roundtable discussions with implementers across Python, JavaScript, C++, and Rust
  
- Hands-on guidance for Virtual Zarr and cloud-native data access
  
- Migration support for organizations considering Zarr v3 adoption
  
- Direct input into the tools being built
  
- Cross-collaborations with participants from the STAC sprint
