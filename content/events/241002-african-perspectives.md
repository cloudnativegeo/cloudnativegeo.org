description: "In this webinar, moderated by [Dalton Lunga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalton-lunga-a6411a4/), a senior research scientist at [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov/), we explore applications of cloud-native geospatial on the African continent. [Daniel Nwaeze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-nwaeze/) will talk about the conversion of LandCoverNet to the Zarr format, which optimizes geospatial data management in cloud-native environments. Earth Observation Data Scientist, at Digital Earth Africa, [Mpho Sadiki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mpho-sadiki-086662174/), will present on the crop-type mapping workflow, which is designed to be used in the Digital Earth Africa Sandbox and is provided as a collection of documented Jupyter notebooks in an open GitHub repository. [Victoria Neema](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/about-us/our-team/victoria-neema), Earth observation data scientist at Digital Earth Africa will discuss the DE Africa Waterbodies Service, which maps over 700,000 waterbodies across Africa and tracks changes in their water surface area over three decades."
