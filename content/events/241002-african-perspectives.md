description: "In this webinar, moderated by [Dalton Lunga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalton-lunga-a6411a4/), a senior research scientist at [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov/), we explored applications of cloud-native geospatial on the African continent. [Daniel Nwaeze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-nwaeze/) talked about the conversion of LandCoverNet to the Zarr format, which optimized geospatial data management in cloud-native environments. Earth Observation Data Scientist at Digital Earth Africa, [Mpho Sadiki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mpho-sadiki-086662174/), presented on the crop-type mapping workflow, which was designed to be used in the Digital Earth Africa Sandbox and was provided as a collection of documented Jupyter notebooks in an open GitHub repository. [Victoria Neema](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/about-us/our-team/victoria-neema), Earth observation data scientist at Digital Earth Africa, discussed the DE Africa Waterbodies Service, which mapped over 700,000 waterbodies across Africa and tracked changes in their water surface area over three decades."
