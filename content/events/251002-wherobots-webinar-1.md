description: "Are you building a next-generation application for spatial data in the cloud? The team behind Apache Sedona and Wherobots is focused on enabling spatial data processing standards and best practices in cloud native environments. But in order to do this, we know we need to help address significant bottlenecks in storage, compute, and innovation. SedonaDB and the SpatialBench are the next phases for accelerating innovation, and with these projects, we want to unlock innovation through a Startup Accelerator program run by Wherobots.Join us to explore these topics with Dewey Dunnington, Jia Yu, and Matt Forrest from Wherobots."
