summary: "We have partnered with thriveGEO to accelerate training and capacity building for cloud-native spatial skills."

One of our goals at CNG is to create a larger and more diverse community of geospatial data practitioners. While tremendous progress is being made to make geospatial data easier to access and use in the cloud, we know that there are many people in need of training and educational opportunities to benefit from this progress. 

To this end, we are starting to experiment with issuing badges to recognize individuals who have completed cloud-native geospatial trainings. We have started by partnering with [thriveGEO](https://thrivegeo.com), a training and technical consulting company based in Germany. In April 2025, thriveGEO gave its first [Cloud-Native Geospatial 101](https://thrivegeo.com/cloud-native-geospatial-101/) training course and we have issued CNG Badges to course participants. 

CNG Badges use the [Open Badges Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0) which allows us to give people a verifiable digital credential that asserts they have completed a CNG-approved training course. By maintaining a vendor-neutral view of the geospatial technology landscape, we seek to establish CNG Badges as a way for employers to identify staff who have broadly-applicable skills and are up to date on new developments in the geospatial field.

We look forward to continuing our partnership with thriveGEO as they create and deliver more trainings. If you are interested in providing training courses on cloud-native geospatial techniques and would like to partner with us to issue badges, please write us at hello@cloudnativegeo.org
