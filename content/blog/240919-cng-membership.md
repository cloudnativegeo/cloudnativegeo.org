We’re excited to announce the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum (CNG) membership program. We have [changed our name, but not our commitment to making geospatial data easier to access and use](https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog/2024/09/introducing-cng/).

As geospatial data becomes more important, so does the need for a vendor-agnostic, trusted platform to help people understand the true benefits and limitations of geospatial technology. CNG is stepping up to meet this need, providing a neutral forum where geospatial data users can come together and exchange ideas, share experiences, and learn from one another. Our membership program is designed to unite and empower a diverse community of geospatial professionals from across industries and specialties.

In the last few years, we’ve witnessed how the cloud ecosystem, fueled by open standards, has changed how we work with geospatial data online. Cloud-native technologies have created capabilities that have been rapidly adopted across the commercial and public sectors. Despite this, many geospatial communities remain siloed by industry or domain, limiting knowledge sharing across the community. CNG bridges this gap by creating opportunities for government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofits, international organizations, commercial enterprises, and startups to connect and collaborate.

The membership program was created in this spirit.
