On behalf of the Cloud-Native Geospatial Foundation, we invite your organization to become a sponsor for the upcoming working sprint on **Enhancing Air Quality Data Access in Africa**. This event will be held on July 30-31, 2024 at the Radisson Blu Hotel & Convention Centre in Kigali, Rwanda. Building on Rwanda’s leadership in air quality initiatives, we’re convening local professionals, as well as experts from across Africa and around the world. 

### Why Rwanda?
Africa faces some of the most severe air quality challenges. Fortunately, the affordability of air quality sensors have led to improved monitoring and a wealth of data across the continent and the world. While this is a positive development, the lack of common data schemas and file formats hinders effective sharing and analysis, limiting this data’s potential to inform air quality solutions. By convening this sprint in Africa, we can leverage the expertise and perspectives of African air quality professionals to explore the need for accessible and user-friendly data formats to make air quality data easier to access and use. 

The overall goal is to facilitate easier air quality data sharing by understanding how air quality data is used to inform decision-making and environmental policy by leaders in Africa. This will not only empower African research communities, many of whom are often excluded from global working sprints due to visa restrictions but also benefit air quality analysis efforts worldwide. This sprint is by invitation only but do [sign up here to stay informed](https://cloudnativegeo.us21.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9007e9da43631cae49faa141c&id=2015a8d705) about future air quality initiatives.

### Your sponsorship will directly contribute 
- **Enhancing Global Representation:** Providing travel and accommodation grants for international participants to create a globally diverse group of air quality professionals can participate, fostering an inclusive approach.
