We are excited to announce the founding CNG Editorial Board, a group of leaders in our community who have graciously volunteered to guide our work. The experience and good judgment of our board helps us identify new technologies on the horizon and what fads can we safely ignore as we create our events and content.

The editorial board is also designed to provide opportunities for visibility and leadership to our community members. Half of the CNG editorial board will be replaced every 12 months with new members selected by the existing editorial board. This will allow us to gain expertise from more people throughout our community and support emerging leaders.

We are immensely grateful to our board for their support as we build CNG together.
