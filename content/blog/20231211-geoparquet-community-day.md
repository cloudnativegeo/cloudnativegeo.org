Join us on January 30, 2024, in San Francisco for our inaugural [GeoParquet Community Day](https://lu.ma/GeoParquetSprint) to highlight the usage of spatial data in Parquet, open table formats, and cloud-native spatial analytics. We are proud to have [Wherobotics](https://wherobots.com/) as the convening sponsor. 

**Why GeoParquet**

GeoParquet is an open-source project that recently [released version 1.0.0](https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog/2023/10/the-geoparquet-ecosystem-at-1.0.0/), marking the culmination of extensive development, testing, and real-world usage. This stable foundation ensures reliability and consistency for the geospatial data community.

GeoParquet integrates spatial data into the Apache Parquet format, unlocking opportunities for data analysts, scientists, and engineers. It simplifies working with spatial data in the cloud and enables sophisticated spatial analytics.

**The GeoParquet Community Day**

The goal of this event is to introduce GeoParquet and the benefits of its practical applications to more people. Participants will learn from experts about how GeoParquet integrates into the spatial data ecosystem and engage in hands-on experience building an application. 

**What to expect**

- Discussions about sharing geospatial data in tabular formats
- Cloud-native spatial analytics exploration
- Networking opportunities with GeoParquet experts
