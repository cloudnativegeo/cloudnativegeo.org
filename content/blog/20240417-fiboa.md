I am pleased to announce [fiboa](https://github.com/fiboa/) (**Fi**eld **Bo**undaries for **A**griculture), an exciting new project focused on improving interoperability of field boundary data and other associated agriculture data. I'll admit that most people wouldn't find agriculture data "exciting," but this project has enormous potential to have a positive impact on the world, and we've already started a community of people working on it and sharing my excitement.

fiboa is the first concrete result from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/taylor-geospatial-engines-first-innovation-bridge-jennifer-marcus-jez8c/">Field Boundary Initiative</a>, the first initiative created by the <a href="https://tgengine.org/">Taylor Geospatial Engine's</a> (TGE) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introducing-taylor-geospatial-engine-innovation-bridge-marcus-wmlve">Innovation Bridge Program</a>. The goal of the program is to spur collaboration between academia, industry, NGOs, and governments toward creating shared global field boundary datasets that can be used to create a more sustainable and equitable agriculture sector. We launched this effort on February 26th and 27th at a workshop in St. Louis that brought together almost 20 different organizations. At the end of the two days, we shipped version 0.1 of the <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/specification">fiboa core specification</a>. It gives a common language for any dataset to describe field boundaries and a way to add extensions to add ancillary data and metadata about fields.

Farm fields are a foundational unit of production for any agricultural supply chain. Any efforts to improve agricultural practices rely fundamentally on reliable information about where food comes from &ndash; i.e. where fields are. We're creating fiboa now because we recognize that all of technology we need is now readily available to create planetary-scale field boundary data products. Led by a community of practitioners who work with field data, fiboa aims to provide a shared language that will foster and accelerate collaboration among everyone working to understand agricultural supply chains.

### Why a common field boundaries data schema?
There's a ton to say about why field boundaries and agricultural data are important, and why the time is ripe for greater collaboration. But we'll save most of those thoughts for future blog posts. The main reason we started with a data schema is that it's a foundational piece that can enable many more layers of collaboration.

Supporting a common data schema is very non-controversial because it allows companies to focus their innovation on what fits into the data schema rather than creating their own schema. This saves them redundant work while making their data interoperable which makes it easier for their stakeholders and other data users. If we're able to create a well-supported common data schema, then tools can just start working with the data instead of having many data engineers create the mappings from one dataset to another (see our blog post on [common data schemas and identifiers](/blog/2024/04/common-schemas-and-ids/) for more on this topic).

### Making data AI-ready
A common data schema is particularly helpful for the other major push of the TGE Field Boundary Initiative: using AI to create field boundary data. Any good AI model needs to train on diverse data input, so providing a common data schema for everyone saves AI experts from spending time cleaning up data and preparing it to train models. Any output from an AI model will also be easier for users to adopt if it also implements a common data standard. The common data standard is a key bridge to help link academic research to real-world inputs and outputs.

### So what is it?

The center of <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/">fiboa</a> is a specification for representing field boundary data in GeoJSON &amp; GeoParquet in a standard way, with several optional 'extensions' that specify additional attributes. But we believe that thinking of fiboa as *just* a specification is outdated. fiboa is the basis of an entire ecosystem of data and tools that enable interoperability of field boundary data &ndash; tools to help convert data (including using AI models to create more data), the discussions and conversations that improve the specification, and the community of people who are building it all together.

We'll walk through all the major pieces below, but it's worth articulating a bit of the overall philosophy first.

Though we don't have a formally published set of collaboration principles, this declaration from [the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1677461) is a good summary of our approach: 

> "We reject: kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code."

We place higher value on practical, working solutions and the broad agreement of participants than trying to vote for the perfect data schema. The principles that guide us are similar to the [Core Principles](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/principles.md) we came up with for the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/), summarized here:

- **Creation and evolution of specs in Github** **JSON + REST + HTTP at the core.**
- **Small reusable pieces loosely coupled**
- **Focus on the developer**.
- **Working code required.**
- **Design for scale.**

Our goal is to focus on the amount of interoperable data, and the specification is just one of several bits that enable it. But, as mentioned above, we need to do this while simultaneously generating large volumes of high-quality field boundary data to test if the schema works in practice. This kind of data would have been prohibitively expensive to produce a few years ago, but this is now much more feasible by using machine learning models on Earth Observation data. The fiboa ecosystem is centered on the interoperable data schema, but it is not an isolated effort - it is linked to all the other open data, AI models, and software tool projects that focus on creating open global field boundaries.

### Core specification

The core of fiboa is quite simple: it is a set of definitions for attribute names and values. One clear example is 'area'. It's quite common for geospatial files representing field boundaries to have a column for the area of the field, but it's often called different things: `area`, `area_ha`, `totalArea`, etc. And even if it's called the same thing the actual data definition could be different: area could easily be in acres or hectares, or even something else. So what fiboa does is pick a definition, in our case area is in hectares, and must be a 'float' between 0 and 100,000. Any data that implements fiboa and successfully validates can then be definitively interpreted as being in hectares.

fiboa officially supports output in GeoParquet and GeoJSON. This means that there are validation tools that can take any data in those formats and report whether it properly implements the core fiboa data schema (along with any extensions - more on that soon).

{{< img src="images/20240417-fiboa-image1.png" alt="" caption="" >}}

GeoJSON generally works best for things like API responses or transferring small amounts of data. GeoParquet shines when storing or moving any sizeable amount of data, since it is a much faster and more compact format. GeoParquet is a newer format and there is not yet universal tool support, but a big benefit is it can be stored on the cloud and clients can easily stream just the bits they need. Major data projects like Overture maps are supporting it and the ecosystem is growing fast, so we decided to embrace it as we envision all global fields represented in fiboa, and billions of polygons are much better served by a more modern Cloud Native Geo format (link). For the TGE Field Boundary Initiative we're using Source Cooperative as our primary data infrastructure, and it works great with GeoParquet.

Thankfully it is quite easy to transform any fiboa data into other geospatial formats like GeoPackage or Flatgeobuf, as the attribute names and values will be retained. We do not recommend using Shapefile due to various technical limitations of the format. Unofficial validators may emerge for those, or we could consider officially supporting them - we just wanted to start with a small core. <sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup>

The number of attributes in the core is quite small, and that's by design. The idea is that most all the 'interesting' data about the field will be in 'extensions'. So even something that many people would consider a core property like 'crop classification' will go in extensions. The reason for this is so that the definitions can evolve more easily, and that we don't have people who don't adopt fiboa because they have their own crop classification system that works better for their use case. The extensions give the possibility of several crop classification extensions. Practically we do hope that one main crop classification extension emerges, and indeed that will likely happen if the largest, most valuable datasets all use the same extension. But we don't believe the small group of people involved at the start is able to get all the core attributes completely right from the start. Indeed we don't even believe that there is one 'true' answer to the right data schema for agricultural data. So our approach is to create the tools for everyone to define what they need and to then validate against their own extensions. But practically there will emerge a number of 'core extensions' that most people use. Much of the inspiration for this comes from the <a href="https://stacspec.org/en&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757995932&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ax4u_vFuGMnWnfLVwgdrj">STAC specification</a>, and there are a number of well-used extensions that have emerged, so our goal is to follow that.


<br>What we do have as required <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/specification/blob/afaa9dd04bf5c5f6b60508ee419b02c31d470052/core/README.md&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757996104&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YheGcCp0BIHEvtTy9S_Ko">in the core</a> so far is just the id and the geometry, and then we have optional attributes for spatial properties like bbox, area and perimeter, and then a couple properties about the creation:</p>

{{< img src="images/20240417-fiboa-image2.png" alt="" caption="" >}}

The method used to create the boundary is quite important, particularly to AI use cases where you would not want to train an AI on data that itself was auto-created by AI from other imagery. We did talk through various times that people care about a lot, but decided that it'd be best to have an extension that is explicit about what each time means. But we did want to have one date time in the core, and ended up with a simpler one which is just the last time at which this particular field was observed, so you can tell if a field is up to date or created awhile ago. We thought about making the attribute required, but did not want to end up with a bunch of bad time data as there are many datasets that don't have precise time information and they'd just end up dumping 'something' in there.

The core will likely evolve a good bit, as this is just an early release. When we feel it's more settled we'll likely call it 'beta', but there are still some big things to figure out, like <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/specification/issues/4">what should be at the 'collection' level</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/specification/issues/13&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757996530&amp;usg=AOvVaw3AXXaFypeLgyeZK8Ld14gL">what to do when different collections of data are merged</a>.

### Extensions

I touched on the philosophy behind extensions above, and it's hopefully clear that extensions in fiboa aren't just extraneous information that doesn't really matter - the bulk of fiboa's value will be in [extensions](https://github.com/fiboa/extensions). There will likely be lots of different types of extensions - some that are specific to a company or organization to help them better validate their own data, some that are very niche and not widely used but valuable to a small number of users, and some that are generally accepted as the main way to do things in fiboa and widely understood by tools. The value of implementing an extension is that it can then be used to automatically validate any fiboa data, ensuring that the values in a dataset meet the requirements of an extension. This in turn lets tools 'know' that a particular value in two different datasets means the exact same thing and can be combined. This should lead to much more innovation in tools to work with the data, since tool providers don't need to code against particular datasets or try to get everyone to convert their data into a random schema in order for the tool to work. Everyone can work towards a common target, creating a virtuous cycle where converting agricultural data to fiboa makes it work with more tools, more tools get created because there's more data in fiboa, and then in turn more data gets converted because there's even more tools that come from converting data.

We put in quite a bit of work to make the [process of creating extensions](https://github.com/fiboa/extensions?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-a-new-extension) as easy as possible (and by 'we' I mean Matthias Mohr did a ton of awesome work, funded by TGE). Each extension is defined by a GitHub repository that contains all the information about the extension and publishes the schemas that tools directly call for validation. The cool thing is that Matthias created a '[template](https://github.com/fiboa/extension-template)' where all you need to do is hit 'use template', run the [CLI tool to update several names](https://github.com/fiboa/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#update-an-extension-template-with-new-names), and all the boilerplate work is already done for you.

{{< img src="images/20240417-fiboa-image4.png" alt="" caption="" >}}

You edit the readme, customize the schema YAML file and create an example GeoJSON file. And then the repo template provides all the tools to convert it to GeoParquet, validate everything, and run continuous integration to ensure each new commit remains valid. And then when you hit 'release' for the repo the schema gets automatically published and any of the ecosystem tools can instantly start validating datasets against it. This was awesome to see in action at the initial workshop, as I was able to fully release a new extension and then validate data against it using the <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/cli&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757997422&amp;usg=AOvVaw0rjbCDAI8AogODgKkF_oZm">command-line tool</a>, in the course of a couple hours. A [step-by-step](https://github.com/fiboa/extensions?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-a-new-extension) guides through the creation process in more detail.

<h4 class="c13" id="h.fnpzzvmws4nv"><span class="c6">Initial Extensions</h4>

So far we've only managed to create [four extensions](https://github.com/fiboa/extensions?tab=readme-ov-file#list-of-extensions), but we aim for many more over the next few months. The one that saw a lot of effort during the workshop was <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/ai-ecosystem-extension&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757997745&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oJARrBaJNxkMma8K9S1yd">AI Ecosystem extension</a>.

{{< img src="images/20240417-fiboa-image5.png" alt="" caption="" >}}

It includes everything you'd want in a dataset to be able to reliable machine learning from it, including things like the author, the quality, the confidence, and whether it was machine generated. In time some of these things may migrate to more general extensions, but the idea was to first get down everything that an AI/ML tool would need to be able to use the fiboa dataset and run models with it. There was also work done in the workshop so <a href="https://github.com/lezcano/geotorch&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757998026&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Phph0v-IPVR2EyVgrNbfI">GeoTorch</a> could easily read in the data.

The other extension made in the workshop is the <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/tillage-extension&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757998241&amp;usg=AOvVaw3n0iHeQS9nWxmwSSvG4LA_">Tillage Extension</a>. I worked with Jason Riopel of Bayer and Katie Murphy of the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center on this one. We started it as a 'management practices' extension, but quickly realized that there were a number of attributes about tillage that people would use, so we broke it out into its own extension. I knew close to nothing about tillage, so it was cool to have them brainstorm what people want to know, what to call the attributes, and how to explain them. The extension is by no means 'done', but we managed to put out a 0.1 release. The next step will be to try to get one or more 'real' dataset converted, to really validate that it works with existing data.

The [INSPIRE](https://github.com/fiboa/inspire-extension) and [FLIK](https://github.com/fiboa/flik-extension) extensions define specific identifiers that are commonly used in the EU and Germany. Those two were added to support [some of the first datasets converted to fiboa](https://github.com/fiboa/data) and [hosted on Source Cooperative](https://beta.source.coop/fiboa/). <sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup>I think that will be one of the main ways extensions get developed - start with a dataset to be converted and look at the attributes that aren't already in fiboa. And then figure out if some of them are really 'common' ones that many datasets would want to represent. It's worth doing some looking [at other datasets](https://github.com/fiboa/data-survey), but since making an extension is so easy it's also great to just create the extension and then solicit feedback as others hit similar problems, and evolve it in the open.</p>

<h4 class="c13" id="h.8itjzplckh5l"><span class="c6">Next Extensions</h4>

While each extension gets an individual repository, we also have an overall Extensions Repository at <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/extensions&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757999094&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hQDv14STtm22TUR6q_4rA">https://github.com/fiboa/extensions</a> that lists all available extensions and also serves as an issue tracker for potential new extension. Right now we've only got [a couple of extensions listed as priorities](https://github.com/fiboa/extensions/issues), but the workshop generated many more ideas that we'll post to the tracker soon - things like yield, crop classification, soil moisture, phenology, irrigation, soil information, climate risk, harvest dates, deforestation, ownership information, surface temperature, etc.

Two of the listed ones are pretty critical to get to soon. One is ID's, and in particular we're interested in things like Varda's <a href="https://www.varda.ag/global-field-id&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757999308&amp;usg=AOvVaw12IpaLrNshpBP7iGDUgo47">Global FieldID</a> being represented easily, to help promote their awesome work. And we've also seen that there are many other ID schemes that are important to people. The other is Timestamps, which we anticipate being a deep discussion of all the different types of time that people care about with fields - we started talking about it at the workshop, and it became clear it was a much bigger topic than we could handle in an hour or two. We also ticketed 'management practices', which likely is a number of smaller extensions on cover crop, fertility, crop protection, manure, irrigation, residue management, etc. But it may make sense to have an overarching extension that groups them together.

Extensions are generally the area that is ripest for collaboration, and we're keen to get at least some initial alpha releases out. The recommended way to work on these is to start with one dataset that represents some additional data related to field boundaries and see how they do it. Ideally at least a couple other datasets that represent the same attributes are found, and if they all do things similarly then it should be easy to determine what goes in the extension. If their approach differs then just pick the one that makes the most sense and is the most future proof. The idea is to release 'early and often', and to get feedback through actually 'doing', not trying to gather all potential stakeholders in a room. Ideally by a '1.0 release' of any extension there are a number of different datasets in fiboa that use the extension, so we feel confident that it will work well.</p>

<h4 class="c13"><span class="c6">Tools</h4>

As part of the initial release Matthias Mohr has built a number of tools to make the ecosystem more immediately useful. We'll likely do some blog posts, tutorials and workshops, so I'm just going to give a brief overview and not going to get very deep into the details here.

The main tools are all available from the <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/cli&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402757999877&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YqJ4H8yUBnmp-y3ZGGfBP">fiboa command-line interface</a> (cli). This can be easily installed by running `pip install fiboa-cli` any command line with python 3.9 or above installed. It works like any command-line tool, and you can just type 'fiboa' on your command line and you should see the tools available:

{{< img src="images/20240417-fiboa-image7.png" alt="" caption="" >}}

The most important command is likely 'validate', which lets you check any GeoJSON and GeoParquet file to confirm whether it is a valid fiboa file. This operation is key to ensure interoperability - it does no good to just have people 'try' to implement the specification with no way to ensure that they are doing it correctly. Validation will ideally be written into any workflow with fiboa data, to ensure all tools can count on it being represented properly.

The cool thing is that the validation is all completely dynamic. fiboa files themselves point at the versions of core and extensions that they declare themselves as supporting, which means if there is a new release then they can immediately point at the new release files location and the validators will check against the latest. So there does not need to be a new release of the validators for each new extension release - it automatically follows where the file points.

The 'describe' tool is a favorite of mine, to quickly get a sense of the data.

The fiboa 'create' tool is also quite useful, as it can take one or more GeoJSON files and transform it into the GeoParquet version.

There is also a new converter tool, which can take non-fiboa data and help you turn it into fiboa data. Each converter must be implemented as part of the cli library, but once it's there then it's available for anyone to convert any 'official' data to the fiboa version. Currently there are converters for open datasets in Germany and Austria, but it is relatively easy to add one, and will make it simple for any user of agricultural datasets to convert them.

### Data

For the initial fiboa announcement we wanted to be sure that there was at least one 'real' dataset available to try out. Matthias converted one, and then made the conversion tool and promptly got a couple more converted.

{{< img src="images/20240417-fiboa-image6.png" alt="" caption="" >}}

The first ones are Field Boundaries for [Austria and four federal states in Germany](https://github.com/fiboa/data), all available on [Source Cooperative](https://beta.source.coop/fiboa/). For those who aren't familiar with Source it's a hosting infrastructure provided by Radiant Earth, built with great support <a href="https://cloudnativegeo.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402758001508&amp;usg=AOvVaw1URbZ9BcNgE62w6IIi9q_g">Cloud Native Geospatial</a> formats. We'll likely put most public datasets up on Source Cooperative, as it's a great platform, and anyone else is also welcome to host their fiboa-compliant datasets there. But you can also easily host them on any cloud, and even just use them locally. But it can be quite beneficial to put larger data up there, as it becomes easy for users to download just the subset of data that they want.

In addition to the existing datasets, Hannah Kerner and her students are undertaking a massive effort to convert a number of datasets that are good for training AI models. They'll be putting those up on Source periodically, and in a couple months we should get a great harmonized, globally sampled dataset.

### Community

While there's a great start to the ecosystem above, it's still quite early, so the most important thing we can do is build an amazing community who can make this effort far bigger than we've dreamed of. We did the initial workshop in person to build up trust and connection as humans in an initial group, but our next goal is for the community to be centered online, in the style of the best open communities that we all know about. This doesn't mean we won't do any more in person events, but those will enhance the core collaborations. It will take some time to transition, and this is where we could use help! Mostly by joining in the effort, especially if you weren't in the original workshop. We will not see this effort as successful until there are more people contributing than there were at the first workshop.

So we've just recently started forming the rituals and communications that form the community. The center will certainly be the <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402758002253&amp;usg=AOvVaw1iqFhTd_VerQyJ1sqw-jme">fiboa organization</a> on GitHub. This is where the core spec lives, where all the extensions live, where the core tools live, and where the <a href="https://github.com/fiboa/specification/discussions&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402758002348&amp;usg=AOvVaw3NP8iIPfmDzmF4IUp2t-7R">discussion forum</a> lives. It's also where we're doing all the project management of all the different pieces, at <a href="https://github.com/orgs/fiboa/projects/2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402758002439&amp;usg=AOvVaw3LlC8yHLjov5Mvpd35dWSN">https://github.com/orgs/fiboa/projects/2</a> (we may add other boards in the future too). We've got repos to track software, data, communications and extensions, plus all the individual tool, spec and extension repositories, and they all roll up to the org-wide project.

We do think some real-time discussion can really move things forward, so we will have bi-weekly zoom meetings to check-in on progress and update the project boards. But we aim to follow best practice for online communities, aiming to make all decisions fully online in the repositories, and posting everything that happens, so that it's a complement to the core running of the project, not how the project is run. We'll also aim for a number of 'break out' sessions, to enable higher bandwidth collaboration, on key topics like defining new extensions, delving into core spec questions, or giving deeper demo sessions. Anyone and everyone is welcome to join both the bi-weekly calls and any break-out sessions. You can add these calls  to your google calendar <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action%3DTEMPLATE%26tmeid%3DMnQ3cXJmdjM4bjJibGN1cjQzZjRmanZmdTZfMjAyNDA1MDFUMTUwMDAwWiBjX2U0NmNkMTRlMmU1OWQxOWMzMTNjMDIwYjI5ZmVlYmFhN2Y2MGQzYzc4OTdjNjNlZWQ5ODgyZjQwOGFiYjQxZWVAZw%26tmsrc%3Dc_e46cd14e2e59d19c313c020b29feebaa7f60d3c7897c63eed9882f408abb41ee%2540group.calendar.google.com%26scp%3DALL&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402758002855&amp;usg=AOvVaw3NqxO7H3u8ftnRTMOX0EUp">here</a>  and/or join the #fiboa slack channel on the Cloud Native Geospatial slack.<sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup> And yes! We've got a slack, and that'll be where async / chat communication happens. Join us<a href="https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNjk1NzI2NTI3NTA5Mi02ZTZmYWFlYzIzNDcyYTE3OWU1YmRjMjE3MTAwZGI4ZWE0YzdhOTFiMjlkMGU4MmFkNWQxMzAxOTQ2ZjY3NDAx&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402758003097&amp;usg=AOvVaw11whysv0kq1nqNo4srNrJp">here</a>..</p>

### Join us!

So I hope this post served as a solid introduction to what fiboa is. We'll aim to follow-up soon with more of the 'why', but if you've read all the way to here and don't think we're crazy (or think we're the right kind of crazy) then please consider joining us! We certainly can't do it all alone, and this movement is only going to succeed beyond our dreams if we manage to attract far more people than the original group. We've got a lot of great momentum, and the amazing support of Taylor Geospatial Engine, but the goal is to use these next months to really bootstrap the community that will live beyond the initial <a href="https://tgengine.org/introducing-taylor-geospatial-engine-and-the-innovation-bridge-program/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1713402758003405&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Lglt5UXPzh3V92tfW1_fE">Innovation Bridge initiative</a>.

There's lots of places to jump in and contribute, and many were mentioned above. If you'd like to learn more than definitely join our slack or jump into the bi-weekly meetings - you're welcome to just join and observe. And if you just want to 'do something' then the best way is to actually try to take an existing field boundary dataset and try to convert it to fiboa, and to upload it to Source Cooperative. We'll aim to have tutorials on how to do this soon, along with tags in our projects on ideas for good first tasks. But until then just jump in and ask. We look forward to working with you, and building this project together!

I&#39;m ok with like more than a line or two, but I think we should keep it under a paragraph.</p></div><div class="c2"><p class="c9"><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a>todo: update screenshot after we do https://github.com/fiboa/specification/issues/18</p></div><div class="c2"><p class="c9"><a href="#cmnt_ref3" id="cmnt3">[c]</a>To be updated by me...</p></div><div class="c2"><p class="c9"><a href="#cmnt_ref4" id="cmnt4">[d]</a>To be refined</p></div><div class="c2"><p class="c9"><a href="#cmnt_ref5" id="cmnt5">[e]</a>To be updated</p></div><div class="c2"><p class="c9"><a href="#cmnt_ref6" id="cmnt6">[f]</a>Maybe just link to the data repo?</p></div><div class="c2"><p class="c9"><a href="#cmnt_ref7" id="cmnt7">[g]</a>Jed or Michelle - could change tge-field-boundary slack channel be called &#39;fiboa&#39;, and add instructions here on how to get added - I think we determined that the best is real &#39;full&#39; membership to the CNG slack, not the organization invite per channel, so people can get on other channels.</p></div></body></html>
