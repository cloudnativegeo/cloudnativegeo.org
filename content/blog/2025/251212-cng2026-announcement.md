Next October, we're bringing the global cloud-native geospatial community back to the mountains of Utah. CNG Forum 2026 will gather geospatial data practitioners from governments, startups, universities, and enterprises who are shaping how we work with geospatial data and AI.

If you were at our inaugural forum earlier this year, you know what made it special: over 250 people from over 100 organizations having real conversations about where technology is headed. We surveyed our attendees and received a 4.7-star rating with over 95% of attendees saying they wanted us to do another event. 

So we’re doing it: October 6-9, 2026\.

## **What we're building**

Our goal with CNG Forum is to create a space where the people creating the future of geospatial data can come together to share what's working, what isn't, and what comes next.

For 2026, we're aiming for more participants, but fewer talks. One consistent bit of feedback we received from our first event was that we had too many interesting talks on the agenda. This time, we’re prioritizing practitioner case studies and creating more space for in-depth conversations about creating resilient data ecosystems. We're also adding extended afternoon breaks and short, intentional evening sessions to give people time to enjoy the mountains together and network during the day.

## **A full day dedicated to learning**

CNG 2026 will kick off with a **Workshop Day on October 6**. This will be a full day of technical hands-on training led by experts from across the community. We want these to be practical, skill-building experiences you can apply immediately in your work, whether you're just getting started with cloud-native tools or pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

If you're interested in leading a workshop, we'd love to hear from you. We're offering space for both large workshops (up to 6 hours) and smaller focused sessions (2-3 hours). You'll have full decision-making authority over workshop content and format, allowing you to design a learning experience tailored to your expertise. 

Note that workshop registration is separate from forum registration. You are welcome to just join for the workshop day, or purchase both tickets and experience the full week. 

## **The main forum: October 7-9**

Similar to CNG 2025, we're organizing the forum around three tracks over 2.5 days: 

1. **On-Ramp to Cloud-Native Geospatial** for those new to the field,   
2. **Cloud-Native In-Practice** for real-world case studies and implementations, and   
3. **Building Resilient Data Ecosystems** for strategic conversations about long-term sustainability. 

## **How to participate**

**Get your ticket now**

Super Early Bird registration is now open through January 9, 2026\. After that, we move to Early Bird (January 10 \- May 15), Regular (May 16 \- August 15), and Last Chance pricing (August 16 \- September 15).

CNG Forum is *the* event for data practitioners. Last year, 65% of attendees were senior-level professionals who make technology decisions, architect systems, and influence adoption across commercial, academic, and public-sector organizations. If you're working with geospatial data – whether you're a GIS analyst, data engineer, software developer, scientist, researcher, educator, policymaker, or student – you'll find your people here.

**Share your work**

For the Cloud-Native in Practice track, we're looking for case studies, lessons learned, and honest accounts of what works in production. The bar for talk acceptance will be higher this year, but this is intentional to make sure all talks clearly align with their track. 

The [submission deadline is May 17](%20https://2026.cloudnativegeo.org/callforspeakers).

**Exhibit at the forum**

Want to showcase your tools, products, research, or projects? Apply to [become an exhibitor](https://2026.cloudnativegeo.org/exhibitors). 

If your organization is already an existing CNG Commercial member, you can exhibit for free (space permitting, first-come, first-served basis). This is part of what membership means – direct access to the community that's building this ecosystem.

**Sponsor CNG Forum 2026**

Creating a forum that serves this community well – that maintains quality, keeps registration accessible, and creates space for genuine collaboration – requires support.

Here's what sponsorship means: you're connecting with the implementers and decision-makers shaping how organizations handle geospatial data at scale. You're reaching data practitioners building the foundations others depend on. And you're signaling something important: you're invested in this ecosystem, not just extracting value from it.

We've designed sponsorship opportunities for organizations of all sizes. If you can't swing a full sponsorship on your own? Join forces with others. We've built flexibility into our structure because we know collaboration is how this community works best.

Beyond the event itself, sponsors gain year-round visibility as the CNG community continues to grow and evolve.

## **Why this matters**

We have more geospatial data, better tools, and greater computational power than ever before. The question isn't whether cloud-native approaches will define the future – they already do. The question is how we use these resources to address real challenges, and how we build the institutions and communities that can sustain this work over time.

CNG reflects that through open-standard leadership, community-driven programming, accessible learning pathways, diverse perspectives, and a focus on practical solutions and long-term sustainability.

For CNG 2025, attendees came from organizations like Google, Microsoft, AWS, Esri, Planet, The World Bank, USGS, Meta, NVIDIA, DuckDB Labs, The New York Times, Bloomberg, Development Seed, and dozens more. What united them wasn't their employer or their role – it was a shared commitment to making geospatial data more accessible and useful.

As [Federic Leclercq](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredlec/), IT Project Manager at Flanders Marine Institute in Belgium, put it: "Without a doubt, this was the most inspiring conference I've attended in a long time. The content was top-tier, with so many brilliant sessions and speakers that choosing between simultaneous talks felt like a real case of 'choosing is losing.'"

That's the standard we're holding ourselves to in 2026.

## **Join us**

We're grateful to our founding sponsors – Overture Maps Foundation, Safe Software, Taylor Geospatial Engine, and Esri – who helped establish the foundation that makes CNG 2026 possible.

Whether you're presenting your work, sponsoring the forum, exhibiting your tools, or simply showing up to learn and connect – we want you to join us.
