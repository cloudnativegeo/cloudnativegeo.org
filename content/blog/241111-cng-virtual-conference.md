This week on Wednesday, November 13, the [CNG Virtual Conference 2024](https://cloudnativegeo.org/events/virtual-conference-2024/) will gather data user practitioners, enthusiasts, and newcomers to explore the latest in cloud-native geospatial technology. Come hear keynotes from NASA, Carto, the University of Tennessee, and speakers from many other organizations sharing updates and insights on cloud-native geo. This online event is an inclusive space for anyone curious about cloud-native geospatial, whether you're an industry expert, an innovator, or just starting to explore cloud-native concepts. We invite you to join us to learn, connect, and engage with a field that’s rapidly changing how we work with geospatial data. 

## Why You Should Attend

### Engage with the Future of Geospatial
Cloud-native geospatial represents a transformative approach to handling data. At this conference, you’ll get an inside view into how cloud-native technology makes geospatial data faster, more flexible, and more scalable. And then discover how this shift is driving innovation across the industry.

### Support Industry Adoption
Your participation is important as we strive to help more data users adopt a cloud-native geospatial approach. By attending, you’re contributing to a growing movement to make geospatial data more accessible and useful for data users.

### Connect with the Community
This conference offers a vendor-neutral space for practitioners across sectors to collaborate and exchange ideas. Whether you’re interested in learning or networking, this is the place to connect with other geospatial professionals.

### Help Shape the Future
Beyond learning, this event is about building a community dedicated to advancing geospatial data accessibility and usability. Join us and be part of a community-driven effort to innovate and improve geospatial technology.
## Sessions and Topics
We have a range of sessions lined up, covering both foundational and technical topics, organized into three key sections throughout the day:
### Section 1: Foundations of Cloud-Native Geospatial
We will begin the day with foundational topics, including a keynote from Javier de la Torre on breaking down GIS data silos with cloud-native technology. There will also be insights into how the U.S. government implements cloud-native geospatial solutions and demos of featured cloud-native datasets hosted on Source Cooperative. 
### Section 2: Technology Deep Dive and Live Demos
The second session takes a closer look at the technical side of cloud-native formats with live demonstrations. Dr. Qiusheng Wu’s keynote will explore the transformative role of cloud-native technologies in modern GIS curricula, followed by demos from experts showcasing cloud-native geo solutions like VirtualiZarr, PMTiles, GeoParquet, and Icechunk. 
### Section 3: The Future of Cloud-Native Geospatial
The conference wraps up with a forward-looking session on the power of community in cloud-native geospatial. Dr. Brianna Rita (Pagán) Corremonte's keynote will address the importance of a strong CNG community, and Dana Bauer will lead a discussion on building and sustaining this community over time.
