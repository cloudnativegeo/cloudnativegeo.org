The Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum (CNG) is pleased to announce our 2024 CNG Virtual Conference designed for professionals, innovators, and enthusiasts in the cloud-native geospatial space. We invite you to join us as a sponsor and help make this inaugural conference a success.

About the event: CNG Virtual Conference 2024 will take place on November 13th, 2024. The event aims to bring together geospatial data users from diverse sectors to share insights into the latest advancements and trends in geospatial technology. Through a series of presentations, technical demonstrations, and interactive sessions, the conference will:

- Provide a high-level introduction to cloud-native geospatial technology,
- Deep dive into how these formats are implemented in real-world practice, and
- Explore ways we can collaboratively shape the future of geospatial data innovation.

Your sponsorship will directly support the event’s logistics.

Additionally, CNG operates on a ‘pay it forward’ model, meaning that any remaining funds will be reinvested into future events, educational resources, and community-building initiatives.
