## Our mission
To collaborate with geospatial data practitioners to create events, content, and educational opportunities that make geospatial data easier to access and use.

## Our vision
Our vision is a world where geospatial data is continually made more accessible, usable, and beneficial – empowering communities everywhere to make data-informed decisions.

## How we work

### We organize events
We organize events for our community, including development sprints, webinars, and conferences. 

We are currently gathering our first editorial board who will be responsible for guiding our agenda and identifying gaps in documentation, educational materials, and other areas where we can invest to improve accessibility and usage of geospatial data.

If you want to organize an event with us, [go here](/new-events).

### We maintain online collaborative spaces
Slack and Discourse

### Fiscal sponsorship
Through Radiant Earth, we have offered fiscal sponsorship to projects started by our community members in the past. This is something we hope to do more of in the future. If you're interested in having Radiant Earth serve as a fiscal sponsor for a project, please write to hello@radiant.earth.

## How we don't work

### We're not a standards organization
While we have gladly helped our community develop new methods of sharing and storing data (like STAC, Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, Geoparquet, and Zarr), we do not seek to create standards. Our good friends at OGC are better at that. We hope to help our community find new best practices for working with geospatial data in the future, but we do not define standards.

### We don't create or maintain code or standards ourselves
Our community is able to manage their own projects on their own. We can sometimes help get projects started, but expect most projects started by our community to be managed by community members. We may act as a maintainer of last resort for projects that need a home.

## Our values
These values guide our work as the stewards of the CNG Forum.

### Shared understanding
As an initiative of [Radiant Earth](https://radiant.earth), we share our parent organizations' mission to increase shared understanding of our world through community-led initiatives that make data easier to access and use. The CNG Forum is one of these initiatives. To enable shared understanding, we must create inclusive opportunities where anyone can learn and contribute. 

### Speak through our community members
We don’t have the answers – our community does. Our job is to create a platform for leaders (and emerging leaders) within our community.

### Seek diversity of institutions
The CNG Forum deliberately convenes community members from a diverse set of global organizations including government agencies, academic institutions, international organizations, nonprofits, commercial enterprises, and startups. While we all work with geospatial data, we benefit from learning from peers who have different perspectives, priorities, constraints, and opportunities.

### Always learning
We create opportunities for our community members to continually learn from one another as technology advances. Be open to new ideas and be wary of dogmas. 

### Follow and share data about our community
We look for data that can help our community understand technologies that work and are practically useful. It is not our job to promote certain technologies over others, but we should be a trustworthy source of data about which technologies are being widely used and rapidly adopted.

### Go out
Our community is continually at risk of being too insular and we need to work deliberately to make sure we’re creating a larger and more diverse community of geospatial data practitioners. We need to go out and help bring new people into the fold, particularly people from different backgrounds and levels of experience.

### Go up
We also need to go up to executives and their advisors to help them understand why they should adopt approaches developed by our community. Engaging with senior decision-makers helps keep us honest and gives us feedback to understand if our community is producing real practical value.

## What does cloud-native mean?
It can mean a lot of things. We know that object storage is the future, but we've found that it's not helpful to get bogged down in semantics. The main point is that it's getting easier to work with very large scale geospatial data on the Internet. We want to accelerate this trend and also ensure that more people know about these new efficient methods and can benefit from them.

## Who we are



### What are the benefits of cloud-native geospatial data?
1. **It's faster for users.** Cloud-native formats allow people to interact with massive amounts of data by allowing them to stream only the data that they need for their analysis. By relieving the burden of needing to download and store copies of data before starting a project, cloud-native data saves users time and money, lowering the cost of research and and accelerating innovation.
2. **It's easier to maintain for data providers.** Cloud-native formats take advantage of the performance, scalability, and durability of generic cloud object storage services. This allows data providers to make data available without needing to run and maintain their own servers, databases, or proprietary APIs. 
3. **It's easy to build tools on top of it.** Because cloud-native formats allow efficient access to data over HTTP, they enable the creation of new web-based tools that can interact with large volumes of remotely stored data. For example, the availability of data in Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs has led to the creation of a [wide array of new open source tools and software libraries](https://www.cogeo.org/#implementations). This increased diversity of open source and browser-based tools that can work with data is necessary to increase the size and diversity of the Earth science community.
4. **It scales.** For users who want to perform large-scale analysis, cloud-native data allows researchers to deploy scalable and parallelizable computing resources that are colocated with the data. This can lead to dramatic reductions in time required to perform analysis. For example, [USGS processed Landsat Collection 2](https://www.usgs.gov/news/eros-releases-collection-2-boosting-cloud-access-accuracy-value-landsat-archive) in the cloud 18 times faster than when they processed Landsat Collection 1, which did not use a cloud-native approach.

### What are the benefits of cloud object storage?
Competition within the public cloud sector has reliably led to reduction in object storage costs, continual improvement in performance, and a commodification of services. These trends combine to make public cloud object storage the best available technology to expand access to planetary-scale volumes of data for the foreseeable future.

### How do you encourage adoption of cloud-native geospatial data?
We carry out a variety of activities, including:

- Development sprints
- Paid fellowships for software developers
- Sponsored feature development
- Creation and hosting of documentation and tutorials
- Creation and provision of open source tools and utilities
- Engagement with other community stakeholders such as the [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://ogc.org)

### How do you measure success?
There are a number of ways to measure adoption of cloud-native geospatial data, including:

- Volume of data hosted in cloud-native formats
- Number of software and tools that use the format
- Number of contributors to open source tools
- Number of tutorials available for the format

We will work with members of our community to identify success metrics that we can all contribute to.
