As an initiative of the nonprofit [Radiant Earth](https://radiant.earth), we are community-led and vendor-neutral. Your membership allows us to convene geospatial data practitioners from government agencies, academic institutions, international organizations, nonprofits, commercial enterprises, and startups around the world to collaborate and maximize the potential of geospatial data.

### Why Join?
Joining CNG connects you to a supportive community of data practitioners, grants access to our members-only Slack, gives you discounts on events, and provides opportunities to work on the projects that are transforming the geospatial sector.

### Our Community Members
We're proud to work alongside leading organizations in the geospatial community:
