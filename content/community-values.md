These are heavily inspired by (if not completely copied from) [“The Apache Way”](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/). A key distinction between the Apache Foundation and the CNG Forum is that the CNG Forum does not intend to make decisions about code or data, so some aspects of how the Apache Way governs decision-making do not apply to us.

## Earned Authority
All individuals are given the opportunity to participate, but their influence is granted by the community based on their contributions to the community. Merit lies with the individual, does not expire, is not influenced by employment status or employer, and is non-transferable (merit earned in one project cannot be applied to another). 

## Community of Peers
While we seek a diverse array of organizations to be represented within the CNG Forum, our community is made up of individuals who participate as volunteers. The CNG community is expected to treat each other with respect in adherence to our Code of Conduct.
