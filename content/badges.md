# About the Badge Service

Welcome to the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum's Digital Badge Service! This platform is designed to recognize and celebrate achievements in cloud-native geospatial technologies through verifiable digital credentials.

## What are Digital Badges?

Digital badges are online representations of skills, achievements, and learning. They are more than just images - they contain verifiable metadata that describes:

- What the badge represents
- Who earned it
- Who issued it
- When it was issued
- The criteria for earning it

## Open Badges Standard

Our badge service is built on the [Open Badges 2.1 standard](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/open-badges), an open technical standard for digital credentials. This means:

- Badges are portable and can be shared across different platforms
- Credentials are verifiable and tamper-proof
- Badge data is structured and machine-readable
- Recipients own their badges and can share them as they choose

## Current Status: Beta

This service is currently in beta testing. As we continue to develop and refine the platform, we welcome your feedback and suggestions. During this phase, we are:

- Testing badge issuance and verification workflows
- Gathering user feedback
- Refining the user experience
- Ensuring compatibility with major badge platforms

## Privacy and Security

We take privacy seriously. Our badge system:

- Hashes email addresses for privacy
- Uses secure verification methods
- Implements industry-standard security practices
- Follows data protection best practices

## Getting Started

To earn a badge, you'll need to:

1. Complete a qualifying course or achievement
2. Receive an email with your badge
3. Claim your badge through our platform
4. Share your achievement with your network
