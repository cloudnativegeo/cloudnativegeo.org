## Policy Information
Please see the [CNG Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), which covers expected behavior within any CNG work public or private spaces, including email lists.

## Applicability
All conferences organized directly by the Cloud-Native Geo Forum (CNG) are required to have an Anti-Harassment Policy. 

All conferences organized by an external producer on behalf of the CNG must have an Anti-Harassment Policy. We recommend that you use the policy below, but you may use an alternative policy if approved by CNG. Such approval will only be granted provided that the policy provides similar coverage, and you supply an explanation for the change.

## Anti-Harassment Policy
This policy is based on the one developed by [Geek Feminism](https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)

### Full version (the one posted at https://cloudnativegeo.org/anti-harrassment-policy)

[Event name] is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled without a refund, at the discretion of the event organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sexual language and imagery will not be tolerated in any event venue, including talks. Exhibitors should also refrain from using sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event without a refund. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and related social events.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event team immediately. The team can be found at [registration desk location or similar].

The event team will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security (as available) or local law enforcement, provide escorts to walk you to/from your room/car/taxi/etc, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
